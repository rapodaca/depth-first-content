Chempedia at the Spring ACS

I'll be giving a talk at the upcoming ACS on [Chempedia](http://chempedia.com) - with a dash of [Chempedia Lab](http://lab.chempedia.com). If you're interested in breaking down barriers to using the Web for scientific communication, I'd be interested in meeting with you.
