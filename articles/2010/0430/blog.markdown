DOI Super-Fail

Is the DOI resolution system administered by CrossRef doomed to failure?

Some of you may know that [my company]() recently started privately testing a tool to help chemists keep up-to-date with the latest journal articles in chemistry.

One recent example can be found in the [RSS feed for Angewandte Chemie](http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/rss/journal/26737). Wiley is trying to do the right thing by linking each item in their feed to the DOI through CrossRef - not their own internal URI system. They should be commended for this.

Unfortunately, when the DOI resolver doesn't resolve the DOIs, what's a scientist to do?

Angewandte is a *major* chemistry publication. If scientists can't expect to get an article after following a CrossRef link 99% of the time, what use is the DOI system? We might as well go back to deep publisher links.

My previous alert to [failing DOI resolution]() seems to have generated zero interest from [CrossRef]() staff. Still more examples of problems keep coming up.
