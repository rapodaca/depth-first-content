Second Call For Papers: Recent Advances in Chemical Structure Representation

Have you created, maintained, upgraded, or used a chemical structure representation scheme lately? Few things in cheminformatics are more more central or ubiquitous. Some examples:

-  file formats and line notations
-  in-memory data models
-  human-readable graphics output
-  performance-optimized data structures

I'm organizing a symposium at the [Boston ACS Meeting](http://portal.acs.org:80/portal/acs/corg/content?_nfpb=true&_pageLabel=PP_ARTICLEMAIN&node_id=2060&content_id=CNBP_023925&use_sec=true&sec_url_var=region1&__uuid=61d0357e-14e2-4b32-8fa7-83e6dcab6420) in August 2010 on the subject of recent advances in chemical structure representation.

Speaking slots are still available. If you've got something to say on the topic of chemical structure representation, your abstract would be welcomed. Here's how to submit it:

1.  Visit [http://abstracts.acs.org/](http://abstracts.acs.org/).
2.  Select the link titled "[240th National Meeting](http://abstracts.acs.org/chem/240nm/?projectId=14)".
3.  Double-click on the tree node titled "CINF: Division of Chemical Information".
4.  Select the tree node titled "Recent Advances in Chemical Structure Representation".
5.  Click "Save".
6.  Follow the instructions for submitting your abstract.

Abstracts will be accepted from now until March 28, 2010.
