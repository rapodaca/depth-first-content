Awesome People: Andrew Warner

Ever since [Warren DeLano died](http://depth-first.com/articles/2009/11/06/warren-delano), something has been bothering me: I never told him how much I valued what he was doing. What an inspiration he was to me for his energy and vision. How gutsy I thought he was to go against conventional wisdom with actions. How I wanted to emulate his success in business.

There's no excuse for this. And there are others besides Warren who I'm benefiting from - many of whom I don't know.

So I thought I'd try to change my ways - and use the occasional blog post to highlight some of the people who are influencing how I approach life, software, science, and business.

Today, I'd like to thank [Andrew Warner](http://mixergy.com/about/) for what he's doing to make entrepreneurship less mysterious. For those of you who aren't familiar with him, Andrew interviews entrepreneurs through his [Mixergy](http://mixergy.com/) site. I've never seen an interviewer go into the level of detail that he does, nor listen so carefully and then ask intelligent follow-up questions. Each interview is packed with useful, specific information ready to be put into practice.

Regardless of whether you're trying to build a business or just [fix something that's broken](http://depth-first.com/tags/broken), the stories told on Mixergy contain valuable lessons on how to succeed at it.

Some of my favorite recent interviews include:

-  [Peldi Guilizzoni](http://mixergy.com/balsamiq-peldi-guilizzoni-interview/), founder of [Balsamiq](http://balsamiq.com/)
-  [Hiten Shah](http://mixergy.com/kissmetrics-hiten-shah-interview/), founder of [KISSMetrics](http://kissmetrics.com/)
-  [Scott Tilton](http://mixergy.com/hookit-scott-tilton-interview/), founder of [Hookit.com](http://Hookit.com/)
-  [Joel Spolsky](http://mixergy.com/stack-exchange-joel-spolsky-interview/), founder of [Fog Creek Software](http://www.fogcreek.com/)
-  [Genevieve Thiers](http://mixergy.com/sittercity-genevieve-thiers-interview/), founder of [Sittercity](http://Sittercity.com/)

So thanks, Andrew.
