One-Stop Shopping for Chemistry Journal RSS and Atom Feeds

My last article on [why chemists don't use rss](http://depth-first.com/articles/2010/03/30/why-most-chemists-still-dont-use-rss-and-why-you-should-care) generated a lot of discussion, both in comments and via email, so I started thinking about a solution.

One of the problems I faced in my informal survey of chemists was that there was no single Web resource I could point to that said "Here are the feeds for the journals you read, and here's some simple information on how to use them."

Fortunately, the Web makes solving this solution dead simple - just do it.

So here it is: [everything you ever needed to know about using chemistry journal RSS and Atom feeds to stay current with the literature](http://localhost:3000/resources/rss-and-atom-feeds-for-chemistry-journals).

I have no idea whether this will be helpful or not, but if you're in the position of trying to tell your fellow chemist about what they're missing - you might try showing them this link.
