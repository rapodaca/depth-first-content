The Future of Scholarly Communication: March ACS Talk on Chempedia

I'll be giving a presentation at this March's ACS on [Chempedia](http://chempedia.com) titled "Chempedia: A social medium for chemical information" (ID 10054). Here's the abstract I submitted:

>[Chempedia](http://chempedia.com) is a free service designed to solve the problem of uniquely identifying and naming chemical substances. With the Web's ever-increasing role in chemistry comes the need for a free substance registry as a platform on which to build the chemical information systems of the future. Chempedia addresses this need by offering a peer-reviewed, real-time platform that can be read from, written to, and republished by the global chemistry community free of charge. Created with the recognition that chemistry is an inherently social activity, Chempedia adapts many of the best practices and technologies used in modern social media.

My talk will be part of a symposium titled "The Future of Scholarly Communication". Judging from the schedule I received, this will be a most excellent session that should be useful to anyone interested in the ways scientific communication may change in the years ahead.
